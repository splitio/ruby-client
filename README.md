## Getting started
Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK:
```ruby
require 'splitclient-rb'

split_factory = SplitIoClient::SplitFactory.new('SDK_API_KEY')
split_client = split_factory.client

begin  
  split_client.block_until_ready  
rescue SplitIoClient::SDKBlockerTimeoutExpiredException
  puts 'SDK is not ready. Decide whether to continue or abort execution'  
end  

treatment = split_client.get_treatment('CUSTOMER_ID', 'SPLIT_NAME');

if treatment == 'on'
  # insert code here to show on treatment
elsif treatment == 'off'
  # insert code here to show off treatment
else
  # insert your control treatment code here
end
```
For multi-process environments you also need to setup Split Synchronizer. See [Sharing state: Redis integration](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020673251-Ruby-SDK#sharing-state-redis-integration)
