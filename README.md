## Usage
###Quick Setup
------
Within your application you need the following

Require the Split client:
```ruby
require 'splitclient-rb'
```

Create a new split client instance with your API key:
```ruby
split_client = SplitIoClient::SplitClient.new("your_api_key")
```
###Ruby on Rails
----
If you're using Ruby on Rails

Create an initializer file at config/initializers/splitclient.rb and then initialize the split client :
```ruby
Rails.configuration.split_client = SplitIoClient::SplitClient.new("your_api_key")
```
In your controllers, access the client using

```ruby
Rails.application.config.split_client
```

###Configuration
---
By default the split client uses its default configuration, it will be sufficient for most scenarios. However you can also provide custom configuration when initializing the client using an optional hash of options.

The following values can be customized

**base_uri** :  URI for the api endpoints
*defualt value* :  https://sdk.split.io/api/

**local_store** : optional cache storage
*default value* : custom cache local storage

**connection_timeout** :  timeout for network connections in seconds
*default value* =   5

**read_timeout** : timeout for requests in seconds
*default value* = 5

**features_refresh_rate** : The SDK polls Split servers for changes to feature roll-out plans. This parameter controls this polling period in seconds
*default value* = 30

**segments_refresh_rate** : The SDK polls Split servers for changes to segment definitions. This parameter controls this polling period in seconds
*default value* = 60

**metrics_refresh_rate** : The SDK sends diagnostic metrics to Split servers. This parameters controls this metric flush period in seconds
*default value* = 60

**impressions_refresh_rate** : The SDK sends information on who got what treatment at what time back to Split servers to power analytics. This parameter controls how often this data is sent to Split servers in seconds
*default value* = 60

**logger** : default logger for messages and errors
*default value* : Ruby logger class set to STDOUT

Example
```ruby
options = {base_uri: 'https://my.app.api/',
           local_store: Rails.cache,
           connection_timeout: 10,
           read_timeout: 5,
           features_refresh_rate: 120,
           segments_refresh_rate: 120,
           metrics_refresh_rate: 360,
           impressions_refresh_rate: 360,
           logger: Logger.new('logfile.log')}

split_client = SplitIoClient::SplitClient.new("your_api_key", options)
```
### Execution
---
In your application code you just need to call the get_treatment method with the required parameters for key and feature name
```ruby
split_client.get_treatment('user_id','feature_name', {attr: 'val'})
```

For example
```ruby
if split_client.get_treatment('employee_user_01','view_main_list', {age: 35})
   my_app.display_main_list
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Coverage

The gem uses rspec for unit testing. Under the default `/spec` folder you will find the files for the unit tests and the specs helper file ( spec_helper.rb ). If a new spec file with new unit tests is required you just simply need to create it under the spec folder and all its test will be executed on the next rspec execution.

To run the suite of unit tests a rake task is provided. It's executed with the following command:

	    $ rake spec

Also, simplecov is used for coverage reporting. After the execution of the rake task it will create the `/coverage` folder with coverage reports in pretty HTML format.
Right now, the code coverage of the gem is at about 95%.
