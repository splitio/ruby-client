# splitclient-rb

Ruby client for split software. This is provided as a gem that can be installed to your Ruby application

## Installation
----------

 - Once the gem is published you can install it with the following steps:

	Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

	```ruby
	gem 'splitclient-rb'
	```

	And then execute:

	    $ bundle

	Or install it yourself as:

	    $ gem install splitclient-rb

 - If the gem is still unpublished you can install it through this git repository with the following instructions:

	Add these lines to you application's Gemnfile
	```ruby
	gem 'splitclient-rb', :git=>'https://github.com/splitio/ruby-client.git',
	```
	You can also specify any specific branch if necessary
	```ruby
	gem 'splitclient-rb', :git=>'https://github.com/splitio/ruby-client.git', :branch=>'development'
	```
	And then execute:

	    $ bundle install

## Usage
###Quick Setup
------
Within your application you need the following

Require the Split client:
```ruby
require 'splitclient-rb'
```

Create a new split client instance with your API key:
```ruby
factory  = SplitIoClient::SplitFactory.new("your_api_key").client
split_client = factory.client
```

For advance use cases you can also obtain a `manager` instance from the factory.
```ruby
manager = factory.manager
```

###Ruby on Rails
----
If you're using Ruby on Rails

Create an initializer file at config/initializers/splitclient.rb and then initialize the split client :
```ruby
Rails.configuration.split_client = SplitIoClient::SplitFactory.new("your_api_key").client
```
In your controllers, access the client using

```ruby
Rails.application.config.split_client
```

###Configuration
---
By default the split client uses its default configuration, it will be sufficient for most scenarios. However you can also provide custom configuration when initializing the client using an optional hash of options.

The following values can be customized

**base_uri** :  URI for the api endpoints
*defualt value* :  https://sdk.split.io/api/

**local_store** : optional cache storage
*default value* : custom cache local storage

**connection_timeout** :  timeout for network connections in seconds
*default value* =   5

**read_timeout** : timeout for requests in seconds
*default value* = 5

**features_refresh_rate** : The SDK polls Split servers for changes to feature roll-out plans. This parameter controls this polling period in seconds
*default value* = 30

**segments_refresh_rate** : The SDK polls Split servers for changes to segment definitions. This parameter controls this polling period in seconds
*default value* = 60

**metrics_refresh_rate** : The SDK sends diagnostic metrics to Split servers. This parameters controls this metric flush period in seconds
*default value* = 60

**impressions_refresh_rate** : The SDK sends information on who got what treatment at what time back to Split servers to power analytics. This parameter controls how often this data is sent to Split servers in seconds
*default value* = 60

**logger** : default logger for messages and errors
*default value* : Ruby logger class set to STDOUT

**block_until_ready** : The SDK will block your app for provided amount of seconds until it's ready. If timeout expires `SplitIoClient::SDKBlockerTimeoutExpiredException` will be thrown. If `false` provided, then SDK would run in non-blocking mode
*default value* : false

Example
```ruby
options = {
  base_uri: 'https://my.app.api/',
  local_store: Rails.cache,
  connection_timeout: 10,
  read_timeout: 5,
  features_refresh_rate: 120,
  segments_refresh_rate: 120,
  metrics_refresh_rate: 360,
  impressions_refresh_rate: 360,
  logger: Logger.new('logfile.log'),
  block_until_ready: 5
}
begin
  split_client = SplitIoClient::SplitFactory.new("your_api_key", options).client
rescue SplitIoClient::SDKBlockerTimeoutExpiredException
  # Some arbitrary actions
end
```
This begin-rescue-end block is optional, you might want to use it to catch timeout expired exception and apply some logic here.

### Execution
---
In your application code you just need to call the get_treatment method with the required parameters for key and feature name
```ruby
split_client.get_treatment('user_id','feature_name', {attr: 'val'})
```

For example
```ruby
if split_client.get_treatment('employee_user_01','view_main_list', {age: 35})
   my_app.display_main_list
end
```

Also you can use the split manager:

```ruby
split_manager = SplitIoClient::SplitFactory.new("your_api_key", options).manager
```

With the manager you can get a list of your splits by doing:

```ruby
manager.splits
```

And you should get something like this:

```bash
 => [{:name=>"some_feature", :traffic_type_name=>nil, :killed=>false, :treatments=>nil, :change_number=>1469134003507}, {:name=>"another_feature", :traffic_type_name=>nil, :killed=>false, :treatments=>nil, :change_number=>1469134003414}, {:name=>"even_more_features", :traffic_type_name=>nil, :killed=>false, :treatments=>nil, :change_number=>1469133991063}, {:name=>"yet_another_feature", :traffic_type_name=>nil, :killed=>false, :treatments=>nil, :change_number=>1469133757521}]
 ```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Coverage

The gem uses rspec for unit testing. Under the default `/spec` folder you will find the files for the unit tests and the specs helper file ( spec_helper.rb ). If a new spec file with new unit tests is required you just simply need to create it under the spec folder and all its test will be executed on the next rspec execution.

To run the suite of unit tests a rake task is provided. It's executed with the following command:

```bash
  $ rake spec
```

Also, simplecov is used for coverage reporting. After the execution of the rake task it will create the `/coverage` folder with coverage reports in pretty HTML format.
Right now, the code coverage of the gem is at about 95%.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/splitio/ruby-client.

## Gem version publish

To build a new version of the gem, after you have finished the desired changes, documented the CHANGES.txt and the NEWS, as well as named it properly in the version.rb. This steps assume that all of your new cool features and fixes have been merged into development, and into master branches of the ruby-client repo. Once that is ready to go, you will have to run the build command to obtain a .gem file:

```bash
gem build splitclient-rb.gemspec
```

That will generate a splitclient-rb-x.x.x.gem file, with the corresponding version information on it.
To publish this new version of the gem at rubygems.org you must run the following command:

```bash
gem push splitclient-rb-x.x.x.gem
```

A valid rubygems username and password will be required.

After this action, the new splitclient-rb-x.x.x version is available for its use from any ruby app.

So for instance in a rails app Gemfile, you could add the:

```ruby
gem 'splitclient-rb', '~> x.x.x'
```

line to have the latest version of the gem ready to be used.
