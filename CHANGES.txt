CHANGES

8.1.0 (Oct 3, 2022)
- Added a new impressions mode for the SDK called NONE , to be used in factory when there is no desire to capture impressions on an SDK factory to feed Split's analytics engine. Running NONE mode, the SDK will only capture unique keys evaluated for a particular feature flag instead of full blown impressions.

7.3.1 (Jul 26, 2021)

- Updated streaming domain.

7.1.0 (Apr 30, 2020)
- Added support for the new Split streaming architecture. When enabled, the SDK will not poll for updates but instead receive notifications every time there's a change in your environments, allowing to process those much quicker. If disabled (default) or in the event of an issue, the SDK will fallback to the known polling mechanism to provide a seamless experience.

7.0.0 (Aug 23, 2019)
- BREAKING CHANGE: block_until_ready is now a method in both split_client and split_manager that needs to be explicitly called. The block_until_ready parameter is now ignored if passed in the configuration, and defaults to 15s unless passed as a parameter of the block_until_ready method.
- Added warning to track calls when traffic type does not belong to an existing split (only issued in the online client and when SDK is ready).
- Added warning to the get_treatment's method family when split does not exist in the current environment (only issued by online client and when SDK is ready).

- Added ability to create multiple split_factory instances. Added factory counts and warnings.

- Added configs to SplitViews returned by the manager module.
- Updated localhost mode. Now besides supporting the old text files with `.split` extension (to be deprecated soon), we support YAML (.yaml/.yml) files where you can
  define configurations for your treatments and also whitelisted keys. Read more in our docs!
